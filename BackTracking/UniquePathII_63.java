// 63. Unique Paths II

// You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

// An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.
// Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
// The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.
